Bag-of-word is the simplies language model, which is commonly used in methods of document classification where the (frequency of) occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier. 

The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.
