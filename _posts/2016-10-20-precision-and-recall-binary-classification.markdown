In this article, I will discuss two important metrics for binary classification: precision and recall.

## Precision

Precision is defined as the true positive defined by the total number of positive prediction.

## Recall

Recall is defined as the ture positive defined by the total number of positve examples in the test set

## Accuracy

There is another metrics called accuracy. Accuracy is defined by the sum of true positive and true negative divided by the total number of predictions.
