I this article, I will summarize the basic knowlege of building a language parser(English).

## Context Free Grammar
Context free grammar(CFG) consists of different rules. Generally speaking, there could be numerious different rules.

A string s is said to be in the language defined by a CFG if there is a least one deviation whose yeild is s. 

### Parse Tree
Every sentence can be represented as a parse tree according to the CFG.
### Unary rule

NN -> man;
S -> NP;
