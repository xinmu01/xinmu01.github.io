Simpson's paradox, or the Yuleâ€“Simpson effect, is a paradox in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears 
in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. An example of Simpson's paradox is the 
gender bias among graduate school admissions to University of California, Berkeley.
